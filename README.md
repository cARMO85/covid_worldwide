# covid_worldwide
The goal of the project is to gain insights into how the pandemic has evolved over time and across different countries.

I start by importing the dataset into RStudio and performing some data cleaning and manipulation to prepare the data for analysis. Once I have a clean dataset, I generate visualizations and statistics to answer key questions about the pandemic, such as the number of cases and deaths, the distribution of the virus across different countries, and the effectiveness of various containment measures.

The project includes code to import, clean, and prepare the data, as well as code to generate visualizations of the data. Some of the visualizations included are a bar chart of the top 10 countries with the most cases and deaths, a geographical plot of the distribution of deaths from around the world, and a bar chart comparing the case fatality rate (CFR) across different countries.

Overall, Covid_Worldwide provides a useful resource for understanding the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and how different countries have been affected.
